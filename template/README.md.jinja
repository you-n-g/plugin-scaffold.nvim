# Development

Welcome to contribute to this project.

You can test the plugin in UI with minimal config with
- `vim -u tests/init_conf/lazy.lua -U NONE -N -i NONE` for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

If you prefer to run tests without a user interface, you can execute `make test` to initiate the test suite.
